    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div></div>
    <p>I have lived in the portland metro area my whole life, and was fortunate enough to be in the spanish bilingual program. This enabled me learn about not just spanish but the latin base in which so many languages are derived and grew an understanding and appreciation of other cultures. In highschool I met my wife we went to college together and she has now been a part of my life for more than half of it and we have two amazing children. For years I supported our family doing food service jobs. I worked at restataunts, did pizza delivery, and even became a general manager. During that time my wife learned web development skills, where she was able to get an amazing job doing what she enjoys. Now it's my turn to use my strengths of language, logic, math, and communication to persue my interests in software development, building automations, and fixing bugs.</p>
    <ol><p>My hobbies include</p>
      <li>Cooking and baking. I hope to compile a list of my favorite recepies to share with family and friends.</li>
      <li>Making fun arts and craft projects for my kids.</li>
      <li>When I can, my wife and I love to go to new places to eat and try foods from other parts of the world we haven't tried yet.</li>
      <li>I used to play videogames before having children. When I can have that thing called "free-time" I like to play them.</li>
      <li>Writing fiction, though I haven't had time to do so in ages long past.</li>
      <li>When I can coordinate enough poeple I love to play D&D, and if you don't know what that is your probably not gonna be interested.</li>
