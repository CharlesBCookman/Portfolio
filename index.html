    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div></div>
    <p>I have lived in the Portland metro area my whole life, and was fortunate enough to be in the Spanish bilingual program. This enabled me learn about not just Spanish but the latin base in which so many languages are derived. My respect for languages gave me insight, understanding, and appreciation for other cultures. In high-school I met Amber who I am fortunate to have as my wife. We went to college together. To help pay for college I was in the student government where I learned how to write bills and pass laws. I also worked in the computer lab and after a year became a supervisor writing the training materials for new-hires and tabulated computer lab usage records in case of budget cuts. After college I got married and for years I supported my wife and after our children were born our whole family doing various jobs. I worked in a call center, at restaurants bartending, did pizza delivery, and even became a general manager of a Dominos Pizza. During that time my wife learned web development skills, where she was able to get an amazing job doing what she enjoys. Now it's my turn to use my strengths of language, logic, math, and communication to pursue my interests in software development, building automations, and fixing bugs and other various technical or logic issues.</p>
